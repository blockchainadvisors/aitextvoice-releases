## 6. Hotkey Configuration

### Activation Types

AITextVoice supports four types of hotkey activation:

| Type | Description | Example | Best For |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **DoubleTap** | Press a key twice quickly | Ctrl+Ctrl | Avoiding conflicts (default) |
| **SinglePress** | Press a key once | F9 | Quick activation |
| **Hold** | Hold a key for a duration | Hold Ctrl 1s | Intentional activation |
| **Combination** | Modifier + key | Ctrl+Space | Traditional shortcuts |

### Default Hotkeys

| Function | Default Hotkey | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Speech-to-Text | Ctrl + Ctrl (double-tap) | Start/stop voice recording |
| Text-to-Speech | Shift + Shift (double-tap) | Read clipboard text aloud |

### Changing Hotkeys

1. Go to **Settings > Advanced** tab
2. Find "Hotkey Configuration"
3. Select your preferred hotkey from the dropdown for STT and TTS
4. Available presets include:
   - Double-tap: Ctrl, Shift, Alt
   - Combinations: Ctrl+Space
   - Function keys: F9, F10, F13-F15
   - Hold: Ctrl or Shift for 1 second

**Warning**: The settings will warn you if STT and TTS use the same hotkey.

### Fine-Tuning Double-Tap Timing

For double-tap hotkeys, you can adjust the timing:

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Tap interval | 400 ms | 200-600 ms | Maximum time between the two taps |
| Max hold | 200 ms | 100-400 ms | Maximum time to hold each tap (longer = not a tap) |

**Tip**: If you find yourself accidentally triggering the hotkey, increase the tap interval or decrease max hold time.

### Recommendations for Avoiding Conflicts

1. **Double-tap hotkeys are safest** - they rarely conflict with other applications
2. **F13-F24 keys** are ideal for single-press hotkeys (almost never used by other software)
3. **Avoid common shortcuts** like F1 (help), F5 (refresh), F11 (fullscreen)
4. **Test in your commonly used apps** to ensure no conflicts
